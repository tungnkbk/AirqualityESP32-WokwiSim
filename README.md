Air Quality Monitoring & Ventilation Control (Simulation)

A simulation-based IoT project for monitoring air quality and controlling a ventilation system using ESP32.

Overview:

  This project simulates an air quality monitoring system that collects environmental data and controls ventilation based on predefined thresholds.
The system is implemented and tested in a simulation environment (Wokwi).

Key Features:

  Environmental data collection using ESP32 (simulated sensors)

  Data transmission via MQTT

  Automatic ventilation control based on air quality thresholds

  System design and logic validated through simulation

Technologies

  ESP32

  MQTT

  Wokwi (simulation)
